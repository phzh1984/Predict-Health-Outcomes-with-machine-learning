# Predict-Health-Outcomes-with-machine-learning

The Predict Health Outcomes of Horses project is dedicated to a multi-class classification challenge, where the objective is to predict whether a horse can survive based on past medical conditions. The target variable is the horse's outcome, which can fall into different classes.
